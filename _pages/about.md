I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). My research interests include privacy and security in wireless sensing and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface aided wireless sensing. I received my B.S. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.
