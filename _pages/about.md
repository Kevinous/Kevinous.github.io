I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). My research interests include privacy and security in wireless sensing and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface aided wireless sensing. I received my B.S. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020.

**RIStealth: Practical and Covert Physical-Layer Attack against WiFi-based Intrusion Detection via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface** (Feb. 2022 - Dec. 2022)
* Design a two-phase attack strategy against the practical WiFi-based intrusion detection system by analyzing the robustness improvement modules.
* Design a RIS-aided beamforming method to deflect the reflection energy away from the victim receiver to keep the intruder invisible to the system.
* Design a beamforming-based method to damage the victim system's detection capability.
* Conduct extensive experiments to validate the attacks.

**RISCan: RIS-aided Multi-user Indoor Localization Using COTS WiFi** (Mar. 2022 - Nov. 2022)
* Design a novel algorithm to extract the RIS component from the superimposed channel and design mechanisms to suppress environmental disturbance.
* Prototype RIScan with COTS Wi-Fi devices and customized RIS hardware.
* Conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate excellent performance in multi-user scenarios.


**WiAdv: Practical and Robust Adversarial Attack against WiFi-based Gesture Recognition System** (Nov. 2020 - Oct. 2021)
* Design a signal synthesis scheme to craft adversarial WiFi signals with desired motion features.
* Design two black-box attacks to handle the difficulties caused by non-differentiable processing modules in the sensing pipeline.
* Take the ambient interference signals and processing jitters into consideration to improve the practicality and robustness of the attack.
* Conduct extensive experiments to validate the attacks.
